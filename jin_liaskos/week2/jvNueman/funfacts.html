     <li>At the age of six, he was able to exchange jokes with his father in classical Greek.</li>
     <li>The Neumann family sometimes entertained guests with demonstrations of Johnny's ability to memorise phone books. A guest would select a page and column of the phone book at random. Young Johnny read the column over a few times, then handed the book back to the guest. He could answer any question put to him (who has number such and such?) or recite names, addresses, and numbers in order.</li>
     <li>At age eight he became fascinated by history and read all forty-four volumes of the universal history, which resided in the familyâ€™s library.</li>
