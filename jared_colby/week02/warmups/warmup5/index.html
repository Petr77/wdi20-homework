  When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked
  her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her
  hurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd
  arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she
  made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing
  special.  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose,
  playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to
  him.  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she
  tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When she had no
  success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked
  at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across
  the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.
  She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide,
  whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom
  doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: "Come and
  'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"

  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had
  to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before
  they could grasp what she was saying.  But then, each from his own
  side, they hurried out of bed.  Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his
  shoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is
  how they went into Gregor's room.  On the way they opened the door
  to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three
  gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never
  been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.
  "Dead?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,
  even though she could have checked for herself and could have known
  it even without checking.  "That's what I said",  replied the
  cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with
  the broom, sending it sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a
  movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not
  complete it.  "Now then", said  Mr. Samsa, "let's give thanks to God
  for that". He crossed himself, and the three women followed his
  example.  Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:
  "Just look how thin he was.  He didn't eat anything for so long.
  The food came out again just the same as when it went in". Gregor's
  body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it
  until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did
  he do anything to make them look away.

  "Grete, come with us in here for a little while", said  Mrs. Samsa
  with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom
  but not without looking back at the body.  The cleaner shut the door
  and opened the window wide.  Although it was still early in the
  morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.  It
  was already the end of March, after all.

  The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in
  amazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.
  "Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner
  irritably.  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and
  silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's
  room.  They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their
  hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite
  light in the room.

  Then the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in his
  uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.  All
  of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her
  face against her father's arm.

  "Leave my home.  Now!", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and
  without letting the women from him.  "What do you mean?", asked the
  middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled
  sweetly.  The other two held their hands behind their backs and
  continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud
  quarrel which could only end in their favour.  "I mean just what I
  said", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a
  straight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there still,
  looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were
  rearranging themselves into new positions.  "Alright, we'll go
  then", he said, and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had been
  suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from
  Mr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide
  and briefly nodded to him several times.  At that, and without
  delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front
  hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time
  before and had been listening to what was being said.  Now they
  jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that
  Mr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the
  connection with their leader.  Once there, all three took their hats
  from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a
  word and left the premises.  Mr. Samsa and the two women followed
  them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust
  the men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how
  the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many
  steps.  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and
  would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the
  more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's
  boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his
  way up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women came
  away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.

  They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation
  and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but
  they were in serious need of it.  So they sat at the table and wrote
  three letters of excusal,  Mr. Samsa to his employers,  Mrs. Samsa
  to her contractor and Grete to her principal.  The cleaner came in
  while they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished
  her work for that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded
  without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when
  the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up
  in irritation.  "Well?", asked  Mr. Samsa.  The charwoman stood in
  the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous
  good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked
  to.  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which
  had been a source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she had
  been working for them, swayed gently in all directions.  "What is it
  you want then?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most
  respect for.  "Yes", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh
  that made her unable to speak straight away, "well then, that thing
  in there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it.
   That's all been sorted out."   Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over
  their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were
  writing;  Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing
  everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite
  clear that she was not to.  So, as she was prevented from telling
  them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in
  and, clearly peeved, called out "Cheerio then, everyone", turned
  round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.

  "Tonight she gets sacked", said  Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply
  from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have
  destroyed the peace they had only just gained.  They got up and went
  over to the window where they remained with their arms around each
  other.  Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat
  there watching for a while.  Then he called out: "Come here, then.
  Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and give me a
  bit of attention". The two women immediately did as he said,
  hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then
  they quickly finished their letters.

  After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was
  something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the
  open country outside the town.  They had the tram, filled with warm
  sunshine, all to themselves.  Leant back comfortably on their seats,
  they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination
  they were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each
  other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good
  and held particularly good promise for the future.  The greatest
  improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite
  easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was
  smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by
  Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more
  practical.  All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.  With all the
  worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,
  while they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost
  simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was
  blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They became
  quieter.  Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing
  it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for
  her.  And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good
  intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the
  first to get up and stretch out her young body.
